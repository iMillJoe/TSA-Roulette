# TSA-Roulette
A parody of the TSA's costly randomizer. 

The TSA for some reason, spent quite a load of cash on an iPad app made by IBM.

The sole function of the app is to show an arrow, to the right or left, at random.

This parody of it, gives you about a 1/10 chance, of getting a snarky remark about the TSA's incompetence.
